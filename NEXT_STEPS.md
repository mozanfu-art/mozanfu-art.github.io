## 📋 Your Action Items

### IMPORTANT: Add Your CV File

**This is the only critical step remaining!**

1. **Locate** your CV.pdf file on your computer
2. **Create** a folder named `public` in your project root (same level as the `src` folder)
3. **Copy** your CV.pdf into the `/public` folder
4. **Rename** it to exactly `CV.pdf` (capital letters, case-sensitive)

The download button is already configured and will work once you add the file.

### Optional: Update Project URLs

When you deploy your other projects, update their live URLs in `/src/app/components/Projects.tsx`:

```tsx
// Find these projects and replace "#" with actual URLs:
{
  title: "Hotels Portal IT Graduation Project",
  liveUrl: "#", // ← Replace with your deployed URL
  // ...
}
```
